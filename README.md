# Library-Database
Personal project to showcase a SQL database project.

I developed an SQL database for a library management system, streamlining book and user information. The design included tables for books, authors, genres, borrowers, and transactions. It enabled efficient book search, borrower tracking, and loan management. (Not reccomended for use in professional setting)
